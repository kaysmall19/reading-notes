What is a Text Editor?

A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on
your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that
allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write
to build a web site.

Some Important Features

1.) code completion; 2.) syntax
highlighting; 3.) a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and
fatigue); and 4.) the ability to choose from a healthy selection of
extensions available when you need them.

The Command Line

The command line is an interesting beast, and if you've not used one before, can be a bit daunting.

Example 1

The command line typically presents you with a prompt. As you type, it will be displayed after the prompt. Most of the time you will be issuing commands. Here is an example:

ls -l /home/ryan
total 3
drwxr-xr-x  2 ryan users 4096 Mar 23 13:34 bin
drwxr-xr-x 18 ryan users 4096 Feb 17 09:12 Documents
drwxr-xr-x  2 ryan users 4096 May 05 17:25 public_html
